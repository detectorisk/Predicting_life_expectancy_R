# Predicting_life_expectancy_R
 The aim of this exercise is to fashion a predictive model for life expectancy using various demographic, health, and economic indicators in the Life expectancy dataset. 

Through a rigorous two-step process, data manipulation and regression analysis, I will attempt at building the “best” predictive model. To begin with, in Part 1, I explore the dataset in terms of variables of interest, outliers, potential transformations, and check for possible correlations between those I could consider independant variables. In Part 2 I make use of rigorous variable selection techniques to zero in on a regression model and predict confidence intervals.
